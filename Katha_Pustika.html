              Welcome, pilgrim, to Kāśī (Varanasi), the oldest living city in
              the world and the sacred abode of Lord Śiva. You are not merely
              visiting a place; you are entering a *mahā-tīrtha*, a great
              crossing-place where the veil between the earthly and the divine
              is at its thinnest. This city, resting upon the trident of Śiva,
              is never forsaken, even during the cosmic dissolution. It is known
              as *Avimukta Kṣetra*—the place from which Śiva never departs.
            </p>
            <p data-lang-key="welcomeText2">
              This *Katha Pustika* is your companion on this sacred journey. It
              is designed to connect you with the profound history, spiritual
              vibrations, and sacred traditions of Kāśī, as described in the
              Purāṇas and glorified by the saints. May your yātrā be
              transformative.

              <em>(From the Skanda Purāṇa, Kāśī Khaṇḍa)</em>
            </p>
            <p data-lang-key="sthalapuranaText1">
              In the beginning, when all was unmanifest, the formless Lord Śiva
              and Goddess Pārvatī desired a place on earth for their divine play
              (*līlā*) and for the liberation of souls. Lord Śiva manifested
              this city from his own effulgence. It was not built upon the earth
              but was established in the sky, resting upon the prongs of his
              divine trident (*triśūla*). For this reason, Kāśī is considered
              impervious to earthly calamities and cosmic cycles.
            </p>
            <p data-lang-key="sthalapuranaText2">
              It was named Kāśī, "the Luminous," because it is perpetually
              illuminated by the light of Śiva's consciousness. He declared that
              this city would be the ultimate place of liberation (*mokṣa*). He
              made a divine promise that any being—be it a human, animal, or
              insect—who leaves their body within the sacred boundaries of the
              *Pañcakrośī* (the five-kos pilgrimage circuit), would have the
              *tāraka-mantra* (the sacred mantra that ferries one across the
              ocean of existence) whispered into their ear by Śiva himself, thus
              ensuring their soul's immediate release from the cycle of birth
              and death. This is the supreme glory of Kāśī, the city that grants
              liberation to all.

              It was in Kāśī, at the Assi Ghat, that the great poet-saint
              Tulsīdās composed much of the sacred epic, the *Rāmcaritmānas*. As
              per the *Bhaktamāl*, Tulsīdās would regularly offer water from his
              vessel to a particular tree. One day, a pleased spirit (*preta*)
              residing in the tree appeared and offered him a boon. Tulsīdās
              asked only to have the *darśana* of Lord Rāma. The spirit replied,
              "That is beyond my power, but I can guide you. An old,
              leprosy-afflicted Brahmin is the first to arrive and the last to
              leave the daily Rāma-kathā recital. He is none other than Lord
              Hanumān in disguise. Clasp his feet, and he will grant your wish."
            </p>
            <p data-lang-key="tulsidasText2">
              Tulsīdās did as instructed. Pleased by his devotion, Hanumān
              blessed him and guided him to have the divine vision of Lord Rāma
              and Lakṣmaṇa at Chitrakoot. The Sankat Mochan Hanuman Temple in
              Kāśī stands today at the very spot where Tulsīdās is believed to
              have had this powerful vision of Lord Hanumān.

            <p data-lang-key="kabirText">
              The mystic poet and saint Kabīr spent his life in Kāśī,
              challenging religious dogma. A famous story tells of a time when
              local priests challenged him, claiming that if he were a true man
              of God, the Goddess Gaṅgā herself would accept an offering from
              him. Kabīr, with simple faith, approached the river with a small
              offering of milk. As he extended his hand, a divine arm emerged
              from the waters of the Gaṅgā and accepted his humble offering in
              full view of the astonished crowd, proving that sincere devotion
              is more valuable than wealth or ritual.

              Adjacent to the Viśvanātha temple is the golden shrine of Goddess
              Annapūrṇā, the provider of food. Legend states that when Lord Śiva
              was living as a mendicant, Goddess Pārvatī took the form of
              Annapūrṇā to feed him and the entire world, establishing the
              principle that Kāśī would never lack for food. It is a tradition
              for pilgrims to seek her blessings to ensure they are never
              without nourishment, both physical and spiritual.

              Lord Kāla Bhairava is the fierce form of Śiva who is the *Kotwāl*
              (gatekeeper and magistrate) of Kāśī. When Śiva beheaded the fifth
              head of an arrogant Brahmā, the head stuck to his hand. He
              wandered the three worlds for atonement, but the sin of
              *Brahmahatyā* only left him when he entered Kāśī. Śiva then
              appointed Bhairava as the city's eternal guardian. It is believed
              that one cannot truly complete a pilgrimage to Kāśī or even leave
              the city without his permission.

              The *Kāśī Khaṇḍa* narrates that the Goddess rested here after
              slaying the demons Śumbha and Niśumbha. The deity here is believed
              to be *svayambhū* (self-manifested). The adjacent pond, Durga
              Kund, was once connected to the Gaṅgā river. The Goddess here is

              Dedicated to Lord Śiva as the "Conqueror of Death," this temple is
              a place of powerful healing. The *Kāśī Khaṇḍa* tells the story of
              the sage Mārkaṇḍeya, who was destined to die at a young age. He
              embraced the Śivaliṅga here, and when Yama (the god of death) came
              for him, Lord Śiva emerged from the liṅga and defeated death
              itself. An ancient well (*kūpa*) within the temple complex is
              believed to have medicinal properties.

              appeared here before a sage named Agni Bindu, who performed severe
              austerities. Viṣṇu promised to reside here permanently as Bindu
              Mādhava. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu himself had ecstatic *darśana*
              here, making it a vital site for Vaiṣṇavas.

              While famous for its connection to Tulsīdās, the power of Hanumān
              in Kāśī is ancient. As the eternal devotee of Lord Rāma, his
              presence ensures the protection of all pilgrims. He is known as
              *Sankat Mochan*, the remover of all troubles and difficulties.
              Devotees flock here to seek his blessings for courage and strength

              12th-century structure. The *Kāśī Khaṇḍa* mentions that the
              Śivaliṅga here was consecrated by the great sage Kardama, one of
              the progenitors of mankind. It is the first major halt on the
              sacred Pañcakrośī Yātrā, and it is believed that Lord Rāma himself
              worshipped here to atone for the sin of killing Rāvaṇa.

              The *Kāśī Khaṇḍa* narrates the tale of the powerful demon
              Gajāsura. When Lord Śiva defeated him, the demon prayed that his
              hide (*kṛtti*) be worn by Śiva as a garment. Pleased, Śiva not
              only accepted his hide but also declared that Gajāsura's
              sanctified body would become a liṅga known as Kṛttivāseśvara, the

              performed great penance here. Lord Śiva, pleased, manifested from
              the sacred sound "Oṃ" and established himself as the Oṃkāreśvara

              that a devout king named Vasiṣṭha brought a replica of the
              original Kedārnātha Jyotirliṅga from the Himalayas to Kāśī. It is

              Divodāsa ruled Kāśī, the gods could not enter. Gaṇeśa, in the form
              of an old astrologer, came to "search" (*ḍhuṇḍh*) for a way to
              unseat the king. After succeeding, he was given the name
              Ḍhuṇḍhirāja and the boon that no pilgrimage to Kāśī would be

              *Pādodaka Tīrtha* (Tirtha of the foot-wash water). Viṣṇu
              established himself here as Ādi Keśava, the "Original Viṣṇu,"

              Located near Maṇikarṇikā Ghāṭ, this temple is famous for its

              in honor of his mother, Ratna Bai. After its completion, he
              boasted that he had repaid his debt to his mother. Because the
              debt to a mother can never be repaid, the temple itself leaned
              over, signifying the impossibility of such a feat. It remains
              submerged in the Gaṅgā for most of the year, a powerful symbol of
              humility.
